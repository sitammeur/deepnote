Deepnote is the modern successor to Jupyter—backwards-compatible, AI-powered, and built with a sleek UI, new blocks, and native data integrations for seamless local or cloud workflows. Used by 500,000+ data professionals at leading companies worldwide.

Get started with Deepnote in seconds:

```bash
npx @deepnote/convert notebook.ipynb # This will convert the notebook and create notebook.deepnote
```

Then open your `.deepnote` file in [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Deepnote.vscode-deepnote), [Cursor](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Deepnote/vscode-deepnote), [Windsurf](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Deepnote/vscode-deepnote), or [JupyterLab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-deepnote/)!

## What is Deepnote?

Deepnote is a successor of Jupyter. It uses the Deepnote kernel which is more powerful but still backwards compatible so you can seamlessly move between both, but adds an AI agent, sleek UI, new block types, and native data integrations. **Deepnote Open Source** offers you everything you'd need to work locally before you scale your workflows in a team with **Deepnote Cloud**.

Why Deepnote Open Source?

- **Human-readable format:** The `.deepnote` YAML format replaces `.ipynb`'s messy JSON with clean, version-control and human-friendly structure for projects and notebooks. You can organize multiple notebooks, integrations, and settings into a single `.deepnote` project for better structure and collaboration.
- **Block-based architecture:** Extend notebooks beyond code cells with blocks for SQL, inputs, charts, and much more — all defined and validated through the open `@deepnote/blocks` package.
- **Work wherever:** Run notebooks locally in VS Code, JupyterLab, or anywhere else with the open-source Deepnote Toolkit. Once you want to work in a team on the same notebook with beefier compute - drag and drop your project into Deepnote Cloud.
- **Reactive notebook execution:** Automatically re-runs dependent blocks when inputs or data change, ensuring notebooks stay consistent and reproducible without manual execution.
- **Open and extendable:** Built on the Jupyter kernel for full compatibility with your existing notebooks.
- **Effortless conversion:** Convert .ipynb notebooks into .deepnote projects and back again using the open `@deepnote/convert` CLI and API.

## What can you do right now?

This open-source repository lets you, edit and run Deepnote notebooks directly in your favorite AI-native code editors:

- **[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Deepnote.vscode-deepnote)** - Full Deepnote support in Visual Studio Code
- **[Cursor extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Deepnote/vscode-deepnote)** - AI-powered notebook editing in Cursor
- **[Windsurf extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Deepnote/vscode-deepnote)** - Collaborative development in Windsurf
- **[JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-deepnote/)** - Read `.deepnote` files in JupyterLab with backwards compatibility

## Roadmap

You'll soon be able to:

- Take the UI you're used to from **Deepnote Cloud** and run it locally
- Edit notebooks with a local AI agent
- Bring your own keys for AI services
- Run your own compute

## Deepnote vs. Jupyter

Deepnote extends Jupyter in a number of ways. Here are the key differences:

| Feature             | Deepnote                                   | Jupyter                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Setup**           | Zero setup via cloud or local installation | Local installation required |
| **AI features**     | Native AI agent and AI code completion     | Third-party extensions      |
| **Version control** | Built-in Git integration                   | Manual Git workflow         |
| **Sharing**         | Share with a link                          | Export files manually       |
| **Compute**         | Managed cloud compute                      | Local resources only        |
| **Integrations**    | Native database & API connections          | Manual configuration        |

## What's inside this repository

Reusable packages and libraries powering Deepnote's notebook, runtime, and collaboration features.

**[@deepnote/blocks](./packages/blocks)** TypeScript types and utilities for working with Deepnote notebook blocks.

- **Block type definitions**: Code, SQL, Text, Markdown, Input, Visualization, Button, Big Number, Image, Separator
- **Python code generation**: Convert blocks to executable Python code
- **Markdown conversion**: Convert text blocks to/from markdown format
- **Input block support**: Text, textarea, checkbox, select, slider, file, date, and date-range inputs

**[@deepnote/convert](./packages/convert)** CLI tool and library to convert Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to Deepnote format (`.deepnote`).

- **CLI tool**: `deepnote-convert` command for batch conversions
- **Programmatic API**: Use in Node.js/TypeScript applications
- **Directory support**: Convert entire folders of notebooks
- **Custom projects**: Set metadata during conversion

## Acknowledgements

We owe a huge thank-you to the Jupyter community and everyone who has contributed to open notebooks over the past decade. Jupyter set the standard for how the world explores data and shares ideas through code when it launched in 2013. Deepnote builds directly on that legacy — and extends it into the AI-native, collaborative future. None of this would exist without the foundations Jupyter created, and we’re proud to keep contributing back to the same open ecosystem.
